#sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
#sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Check docker-compose version.

```
#docker-compose â€“version
Output:
docker-compose version 1.21.2, build a133471

Create a directory named nginx in your root.

```
#mkdir /nginx
