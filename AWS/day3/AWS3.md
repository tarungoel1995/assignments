Task 2

create an ansible role before pushing the same to your public github repository.
This Role will simply host an nginx webpage saying
"Hi i am ninja and my name is {yourname}" 
Execute this role in user data script while launching another instance
Your website should be up & running after the system boots up
```
nginx role link: https://github.com/tarungoel1995/AWSROLES
```
```
User data script:

#!/bin/bash
sudo su
cd /
apt-get update -y
apt-get install software-properties-common -y
apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
apt-get update -y
apt-get install ansible -y
apt-get install git -y
git clone https://github.com/tarungoel1995/AWSROLES.git
cd AWSROLES
ansible-playbook main.yml
```

Task 3

write a jobDsl to start stop this instance through jenkins
```
#create a IAM user and allow EC2 FULLACCESS to him 
#add the credentials(Access key, Secret key, region code , format) in jenkins user by which jenkin server is running 
```
```
#Job will take 2 parameters StarStop and Instanceid and will perform respective actions.
DSL:
job('INSTANCESTARTSTOP') {
   parameters
{
  stringParam('StartStop', '')
  stringParam('Instanceid', '')
} 
  steps {
  shell('''
#!/bin/bash
if [ $StartStop = Stop ]
then
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids $Instanceid
elif [ $StartStop = Start ]
then
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids $Instanceid
fi
''')
