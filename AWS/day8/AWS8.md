Assignment 8 AWS

Task 1
Create an infrastructure that would scale as per load: Create cloudwatch alarms for scaling up and scaling down along with sns topic to notify you during any scaling operation
Put fake load on the stack 
scale up if av. cpu threashold > 70 
scale down if av. cpu threashold < 40

# created auto scaling group and set scaling up and scaling down policies i.e. scale up when cpu threashlold >70 and scale down when cpu threashold < 40

#as the maximum limit of instances was set to 5 and cpu utilisation was above 70% instanes got scaled up further.
#4th instance scale up
